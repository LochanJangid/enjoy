If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you
characterize their audio aura?
-- Audio aura is defined by their mood when they listen to songs.
   If they listen to energetic, high-beat songs, then their aura is energetic.
   If they listen to soft, slow songs, then their aura is calm.

Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very
representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you
propose?
-- We calculate it by the type of songs, but this is not complete. 
   We cannot define audio aura using only their top 100 song types and their averages. 
   We should include energy, danceability, and valence along with song types.
   Instead of only finding averages, we should see which song types they listen to with high energy, danceability, and valence.
   Then find the most common combinations and use them to describe their audio aura.
